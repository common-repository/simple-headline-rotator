A simple headline rotator that uses JQuery and pulls data from the FrontPage category.

== Description ==
This plugin takes the 5 latest posts from the FrontPage category and rotates their titles and excerpts using a JQuery scroller. Based on <a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/10/scroll-up-headline-reader">Scroll Up Headline Reader</a> by Karl Swedberg.

User options allow setting custom width and height. Timing and direction of the scroll cannot currently be set by the user.

e.g.

1. Upload `/head_rot` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php headline_rotator() ?>` in your templates

Here's a link to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "Your favorite software") and one to [Markdown's Syntax Documentation][markdown syntax].
Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
